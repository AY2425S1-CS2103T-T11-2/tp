* This is **a project for CS2030S TAs**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a reference to get their students' details more easily
  * as a tool to help them keep track of their students.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _konTActs_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `konTActs` because it is developed for CS2030S TAs to manage their students, store their github details and other contacts like professors and fellow TAs. 
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t11-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
